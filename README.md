# HEBI-ROS
HEBI ROS Examples/API/etc.

> :warning: This repo contains information and examples about the deprecated HEBI ROS API.  The current recommended/supported approach for using ROS with HEBI components is to  use the HEBI C++ API ROS package directly or through the HEBI example nodes which use this package.  Examples and documentation of this approach is as [HebiRobotics/hebi_cpp_api_ros_examples](http://wiki.ros.org/hebi_cpp_api_examples/).
